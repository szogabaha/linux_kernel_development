# System calls - Hello World!

In this work I added a system call to the kernel that collects process information. The following information is collected: state, nice, pid, parent\_pid, youngest\_child\_pid, start\_time, user\_time, sys\_time, uid, comm[]. Careful attention is paid to check validity of arguments passed by a caller.
